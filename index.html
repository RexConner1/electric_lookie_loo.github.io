        <h1>Popular Electric Vehicle Models and Types</h1>
        <p>This chart displays the most popular electric vehicle models and types. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are fully electric with no gasoline engine, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have both an electric motor and a gasoline engine. Let's see which types and models are leading the market.</p>
